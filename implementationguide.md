## Overview

The inzendia project is a web application designed to facilitate daily mood tracking, mood history visualization, and user feedback. The application will be built using a modern tech stack that emphasizes performance, accessibility, and user experience. The development process will follow best practices for directory structure, routing, and styling.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with React
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Architectural Decisions

### Directory Structure

```
src/
  ├── app/
  │   ├── globals.css
  │   ├── components/
  │   ├── pages/
  │   ├── api/
  │   └── utils/
  └── styles/
```

- **src/app/**: Contains the main application logic and routing.
- **src/components/**: Houses reusable React components.
- **src/pages/**: Contains the Next.js pages, structured flatly to avoid nested routes.
- **src/api/**: Contains the API routes for backend interaction.
- **src/utils/**: Utility functions and helpers.
- **src/styles/**: Custom styles not covered by Tailwind.

### Routing Approach

Utilize Next.js App Router for page routing. Each feature will have its own route under `src/app`. For example:
- `/mood-tracking`
- `/mood-history`
- `/feedback`

### Styling Strategy

Tailwind CSS will be employed for styling. Ensure a configuration file is created to set up Tailwind properly.

### Accessibility and Responsive Design

- All components must adhere to WCAG AA standards for contrast and accessibility.
- Implement responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox to ensure usability across devices.

## Tailwind CSS Setup

1. **Installation**: Add Tailwind CSS and PostCSS to your project dependencies.
2. **Configuration**: Create a `tailwind.config.js` file with the following content:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}', './src/components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

3. **Global Styles**: In `src/app/globals.css`, include Tailwind's base styles:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

## Next.js Configuration

If necessary, create a `next.config.js` file for custom configurations.

## Dependencies in package.json

Ensure the following dependencies are included in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "tailwindcss": "^3.0.0",
    "postcss": "^8.0.0",
    "next": "^12.0.0",
    "react": "^17.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.0",
    "express": "^4.17.0",
    "supabase-js": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```
